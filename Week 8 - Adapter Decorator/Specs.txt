 To develop an online game (with super-heroes) implement a software solution that allows:
  1. The use of an external library that contains Disney characters. 
  - currently the game contains its own characters that are part of the ACME framework 
  2. Changing the characteristics of some super-heroes during the game 
  - During the game super-heroes can be equipped with new equipment 
  - The superhero's behavior can change dynamically depending on the interaction with the other characters in the game
